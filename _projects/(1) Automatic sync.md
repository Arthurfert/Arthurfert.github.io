# Automatic synchronization between USB and PC

This project aims to compare file versions between a PC and a flash drive (USB) for automatic merging.

## Precise desciption

The goal is to create a **secure recognition process** to ensure that it is **your** USB and not someone else's, and then merge both drives without any action.

> *Folder sized merging planned*

If the project goes well, a long-term goal would be to have an application that controls which files to merge and which not to merge, and to make it easier to attach new USB drives.

> ***Very important : This kind of project raise high security concerns.***   
> ***It's a very personnal project, and should not be implemented whithout considering the risks.***
